# Data

The /raw_manikin_output folder has the raw outputs from the manikin experiments separated by round (aka. which experimental trial/repeat). 

The /current folder contains the data that is most current and should be used for the linear models. 

The file `ManikinData_WetDry.csv` contains the summary data received from collaborators for each trial. There is a column stating whether the row is from the wet or dry experiments.
